Feature 0002: Verse/chorus indicators in lyrics parsing

Goal
- Improve block detection by treating leading verse numbers and explicit chorus markers as strong signals.
- Keep existing repeat-detection as a secondary signal.
- Support chorus references (`Ref.`/`Chorus.`) that act as placeholders for repeated choruses.
- Allow users to toggle between expanded choruses and original "Ref." placeholders.

User rules
- Verse start indicator: a line beginning with a number, optionally followed by a dot, then whitespace.
  - Examples: "1 Wśród...", "1. Wśród..."
- Chorus indicator: "ref\s?[.:]" or "chorus\s[:.]" (case-insensitive), anywhere at line start.
- Marker-only chorus lines (e.g. "Ref.") can be placeholders for the previously defined chorus.

Scope
- Logic change in Python: update structure detection and chorus expansion.
- API change: allow expanding choruses in responses.
- UI change: add a toggle to show expanded choruses or original placeholders.
- No visual changes.

Proposed behavior
- If a line matches a verse-start indicator, start a new block at that line.
- If a line matches chorus indicator, start a new block at that line and mark block as chorus.
- If both appear (e.g. "2. Ref."), chorus indicator takes precedence for block type.
- Repeat-based detection still marks blocks as chorus if content repeats.
- If a chorus marker line has no other text ("Ref." only), it may act as:
  - The start of the first chorus block (followed by actual chorus lyrics), or
  - A placeholder for a later repeated chorus (standalone block).
- When expanding choruses:
  - Standalone "Ref." blocks are replaced with the first chorus template.
  - The first chorus block keeps its lyrics but drops the marker-only line.

Implementation steps
1) Update `detect_structure` in `app/logic/chords.py`:
   - Split into blocks based on:
     - blank lines
     - verse-start indicator at line start
     - chorus indicator at line start
   - Record explicit type for blocks that begin with chorus indicator.
2) Add `expand_chorus_references` in `app/logic/chords.py`:
   - Identify first chorus template (excluding marker-only line).
   - Replace standalone marker-only chorus blocks with the template.
3) Expose optional `expand_choruses` param on `GET /api/songs/{id}`.
4) Add a UI toggle in song view to switch expanded vs original.

Parsing details
- Regexes:
  - Verse start: `^\s*\d+\s*\.?\s+`
  - Chorus line: `^\s*(ref\s?[.:]|chorus\s[:.])` with `re.IGNORECASE`
- When a chorus indicator line has additional text after the marker:
  - Keep the line in lyrics (do not strip).
  - It still starts a chorus block.

Tests (pytest)
- New tests in `tests/test_logic_chords.py`:
  - Verse numbering starts a new block even without blank line.
  - Chorus marker forces block type to chorus even if content is unique.
  - Repeat-based chorus still works when no marker is present.
  - Standalone "Ref." blocks expand into the chorus template and marker-only lines
    are removed in expanded view.

Notes
- This feature only changes detection; chord propagation continues to use detected block types.
- Chorus expansion should preserve blank lines in the output.
