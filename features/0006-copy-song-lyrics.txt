Feature 0006: Copy song lyrics with optional chords

Goal
- Add a copy icon in the song view to copy lyrics.
- Respect the "Expand choruses" toggle when copying.
- Add a "Show chords" toggle that controls inline chord output.
- Show a small confirmation toast after copy.

Scope
- Song details (read-only) view only.
- No changes to the editor workflow.

Desired behavior
- Copy icon appears at the top-right of the lyrics box.
- Clicking the icon copies the currently displayed song text.
- If "Expand choruses" is on, the copied text includes the expanded chorus content.
- If "Show chords" is on (default), chords are inserted as curly-brace tokens:
  - Example: chord C on the word "Gdy" copies as "{C}Gdy".
  - End-of-line chords append as "{C}" after the line text.
- If "Show chords" is off, copy uses plain lyrics without chord tokens.
- A short "Copied" toast appears after clicking the icon.

Implementation steps
1) Add the copy icon button and "Show chords" switch in `app/static/index.html`.
2) Style the copy button and toast in `app/static/style.css`.
3) Implement copy formatting + clipboard fallback in `app/static/app.js`.
4) Ensure copy respects `expandChoruses` and `showChords` state.

Notes
- Use a Heroicons outline icon for the copy button.
