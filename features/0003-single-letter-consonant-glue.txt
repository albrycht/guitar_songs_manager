Feature 0003: Single-letter consonant glue for syllable matching

Goal
- Improve syllable alignment by treating single-letter consonants as glued to the next word during syllable detection.
- Do not alter the displayed lyrics or stored text.

User rule
- Example: "Z wszystkimi znaki" should be treated as "Zwszystkimi znaki" for syllable detection.
- Applies only to syllable detection / chord propagation logic.

Scope
- Logic-only change in Python: syllable detection helpers.

Proposed behavior
- Before syllable segmentation, transform the text for analysis:
  - If a word is a single-letter consonant, remove the space between it and the next word.
  - Vowel list for Polish: a, e, i, o, u, y, ą, ę, ó (case-insensitive).
  - Example matches: "z", "w", "v" (only when a single letter and a consonant).
- Keep a mapping between original indices and transformed indices:
  - Needed so chord positions map correctly to original text.

Implementation steps
1) Add a helper in `app/logic/chords.py`:
   - `transform_for_syllables(text: str) -> tuple[str, list[int]]`
     - Returns transformed text and an index map (transformed_index -> original_index).
2) Update `get_syllables`, `get_syllable_info`, `get_char_index_for_syllable` to:
   - Use transformed text for syllable segmentation.
   - Map indices back to original text using the index map.
3) Ensure no mutation of `LineContent.text`.

Index mapping strategy
- Build a list where each character in transformed text maps to the original index.
- When spaces are removed, the mapping skips those indices.
- When returning a syllable start index, map via the list to original text index.

Tests (pytest)
- Add a test using the provided lyrics:
  - Given chord `C` placed on "cie" in second line of verse 1
  - After propagation, `C` appears on syllable "ki" in "wszystkimi" in verse 2 line 2
  - Given chord `G` on "wi" in "Przywitać" (last line verse 1)
  - After propagation, `G` appears on "kiej" in "wielkiej" (last line verse 2)
- Test should assert chord indices map correctly in the returned content.

Notes
- Only applied to syllable detection and propagation.
- Does not affect block detection or stored lyrics text.
